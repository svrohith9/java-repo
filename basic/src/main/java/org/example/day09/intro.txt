Hi, I am Venkata Rohith, I am a full-stack Java Developer with over 10 years of experience in developing applications for various domains like healthcare, automotive, and finance. I am particularly proficient in Spring Boot and Microservices architectures, enabling me to drive innovation and deliver top-quality software solutions. I have a good amount of experience in building scalable and resilient microservices using Spring Boot, implementing RESTful APIs, leveraging containerization technologies like Docker, and integrating the REST APIs with front-end applications like Angular and React. My background includes working with distributed systems, service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance mechanisms. I specialize in designing and developing highly modular, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable microservices-based applications.

In my previous role, I was responsible for developing and maintaining a large enterprise system. I worked with a team of developers to design, develop, and test the system. I also worked with the operations team to deploy and maintain the system. The system was successfully deployed and has been in use for over 2 years.


My deliverables would be around 70% backend, 25% frontend and the rest 5% would be documenting APIs and their performance using confluence pages. This is pretty much about me. Throughout my career I have used various technologies like JEE, spring, HTML, CSS, JSP, Angular, Spring, Hibernate, GIT, and latest CI/CD tools for deployment purpose, All major AWS services for Infrastructure setup and Deployment operations. I also have setup infrastructure for hosting the application in various lower and higher environments. I have also participated in troubleshooting the production defects.
